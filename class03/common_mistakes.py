# Mistake 1 -- forgetting self
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, stock):
        self.name = name
        self.stock = stock

    def sell_one(): # WE NEED TO PASS SELF AS A PARAMETER, ALWAYS!
        self.stock -= 1

# Mistake 2 -- forgetting self. for attributes!
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, stock):
        self.name = name
        self.stock = stock

    def sell_one(self):
        stock -= 1 # if you don't put self. before attribute name, it won't recognize it! IMPORTANT!

product = Product("test", 1)
print(product.stock)
product.sell_one()
print(product.stock)

# Mistake 3
Product.sell_one() # THIS IS NOT CORRECT, DON'T CALL CLASS NAME (Product vs product--instance)
# product.sell_one()

# Mistake 4
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, stock):
        self.name = name

        # these are statements, changing state CORRECTLY
        self.stock = self.stock - 1
        self.stock -= 1

# Mistake 5
# don't mix printing and returning with each other!
class Product:
