# if we want the product to describe itself, change price, check availability, etc.
# we would need METHODS


# let's define what a method is:
#   a method is a function defined inside a class that represents behaviour
#   belonging to an object.

# attributes = what the object HAS
# methods = what the object DOES

# what's the difference between these two?
print(product1.name) # taking the raw data! from our instance, or whatever's available in the class
print(product1.get_name()) # we're accessing a defined behaviour by the object.

# let's get more into what self refers to

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, role):
        self.username = username
        self.role = role

    def show_role(self):
        print(f"{self.username} has role: {self.role}")

user1 = User("nina", "admin")
user2 = User("leo", "student")

user1.show_role()
user2.show_role()

# self is the instance the method is working on.
